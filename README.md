## Board game Rummikub


The object of the game is to be the first player to place all their tiles on the table.

The game includes 106 tiles: 104 colored number tiles, plus 2 jokers. Each tile displays a number ranging from 1 to 13, in four colors: black, blue, yellow and red. All tiles appear twice, except for the jokers.

At the start of the game, each player receives 14 random tiles, which are placed on the player's rack, while the remaining tiles form the tile pool.

In order to begin placing tiles on the table, each player must first achieve the Initial Meld: sets (Groups or Runs) with a total sum value of at least 30 points. The points are calculated by adding up the numbers on all the tiles used in the Initial Meld. If a joker is used, it receives the value of the tile that it is substituting. Manipulations are not allowed during the initial meld! 

Tiles must be placed on the table in sets of either "Groups" or "Runs":

Groups include at least 3 tiles of the same number – each one in a different color.

Runs include at least 3 tiles with consecutive numbers in the same color. 

A joker may be used to replace any specific tile. 

Players who have achieved the Initial Meld may – in subsequent turns – use tiles from their rack to create new sets, build upon existing sets on the table, or completely rearrange (manipulate) existing sets on the table – providing all sets created are valid at the end of the turn and no unused tiles remain.

If a player cannot or does not wish to place tiles on the table during a certain turn, the player is required to take a random tile from the tile pool. Each turn ends when the player has finished placing new tiles on the table and/or manipulating existing sets – or alternatively if the player takes a tile from the pool. 


A time limit per turn may be set, if players so desire – for example, a time limit of 15, 30 or 60 seconds per turn. If a player does not complete their move within the time limit, the player must return all tiles to their previous position.


If the game has not yet been won but all tiles in the pool have been used, each player has just one more turn. The game will then end and each player adds up the value of their remaining tiles on their rack. The player with the lowest score wins.
